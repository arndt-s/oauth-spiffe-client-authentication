In modern cloud-native architectures where identity is managed by SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone), there is a need to provision additional secret material for OAuth clients when attested identifiers and credentials such as SVIDs are already available.\n```\n**draft-schwenkschuster-oauth-spiffe-client-auth.md:102**\n* Ensure that the updated term 'cryptographically verifiable credentials' on line 102 aligns with the document's overall terminology and previously defined concepts.\n```\nThe SPIFFE profile for client authentication enables seamless integration between SPIFFE-based and OAuth-based systems, allowing applications to leverage both ecosystems without requiring additional credential management. It also enables a more secure authentication method by leveraging cryptographically verifiable credentials rather than shared secrets.\n```\n</details>\n\n",
